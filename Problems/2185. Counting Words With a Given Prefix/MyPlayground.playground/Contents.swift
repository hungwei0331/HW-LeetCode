/*
 You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.
 Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.
 A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

 Example 1:
 Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
 
 Example 2:
 Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
 Output: 0
 Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
  
 Constraints:
 1 <= words.length <= 100
 1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100
 words[i] and pref consist of lowercase English letters.

// TC: O(n * l + m),

// searching for the prefix takes O(m) operations.

// SC: O(n * l),
// n words of maximum length l, the Trie can contain up to O(n * l) nodes
