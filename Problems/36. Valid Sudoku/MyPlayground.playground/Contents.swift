/*
 Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

 Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 Note:

 A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
  

 Example 1:


 Input: board =
 [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: true
 Example 2:

 Input: board =
 [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

// TC: O(N^2), because we need to traverse every position in the board, and each of the four check steps is an O(1) operation.
// SC: O(N^2), because in the worst-case scenario, if the board is full, we need a hash set each with size N to store all seen numbers for each of the N rows, N columns, and N boxes, respectively.
